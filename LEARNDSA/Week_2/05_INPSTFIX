Infix to Postfix

You are given an infix expression S of length N. You need to convert the given expression S to its postfix equivalent using stack.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the length of S.
The second line contains a string S, the infix expression.
Output
For each test case print a single line containing the postfix equivalent for the given infix expression.

Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤102
S contains only uppercase English letters (A...Z), and these characters - (,),+,−,∗,/,^. S is a valid infix expression.
Example Input
2
15
((A+B)*D)^(E-F)
19
A+(B*C-(D/E^F)*G)*H
Example Output
AB+D*EF-^
ABC*DEF^/G*-H*+
Explanation
