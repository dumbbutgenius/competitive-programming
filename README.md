## How to view submissions?
Every directory contains the problems related to that contest or training session

The files with .cpp extension are the source codes and those without any extensions are the problem statements

Every submission has a number as prefix that represents sequence in which they were solved

Every submission has a number as suffix that represents the different approcaches to the problem
