# competitive-programming
My training and competitions in programming contests

## training
Problems solved to learn and improve skills from the ground up

## competitions
Problems solved in official rounds, and while upsolving (solving problems that couldn't be done in contests later)

## How to view submissions?
Every directory contains the problems related to that contest or training session
The files with .cpp extension are the source codes and those without any extensions are the problem statements
Every submission has numbers as prefix that represent sequence in which they were solved
Every submission has numbers as suffix that represent the different approcaches to the problem
