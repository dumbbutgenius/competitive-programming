# Number Theory

Concepts and practice problems for introduction to number theory

Model it as an equation if possible

## Floor/ceil

floor(x) = x rounded down
ceil(x) = x rounded up

florr(2.5) = 2
ceil(2.5) = 3
floor(2) = 2
ceil(2) = 2

## Divisors

* a | b <-> a divides b <-> b is divisible by a <-> b % a = 0
* Divisor/factor of x: a number y such that y | x
* Prime number: only divisible by 1 and itself
* Prime factorization: Breaking a number down into product of it's prime factors as far as possible (or prime powers, p^k where k is an integer power to a prime p)
	- 2 -> 2
	- 10 -> 2, 5
	12 -> 2^2, 3
